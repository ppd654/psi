[00:00.01]Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
[00:04.64]But I won't feel {blue}
[00:08.45]Like I {always} do
[00:12.09]'Cause {somewhere} in the crowd there's you
[00:30.24]I {was} sick and tired of everything
[00:34.40]When I {called} you last night from Glasgow
[00:38.82]All I do is eat and sleep and sing
[00:42.46]Wishing every show was the last show
[00:47.81]So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
[00:52.10]Suddenly I feel all right
[00:55.79]And it's gonna be so different
[00:57.80]When I'm on the stage tonight
[01:02.44]Tonight the
[01:04.33]Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
[01:08.53]Shining like the sun
[01:12.22]Smiling, having fun
[01:16.05]Feeling like a number one
[01:48.93]Facing twenty thousand of your friends
[01:54.00]How can anyone be so lonely
[01:58.47]Part of a success that never ends
[02:02.09]Still I'm thinking about you only
[02:07.20]There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
[02:11.74]But it's gonna be alright
[02:15.79]Everything will be so different
[02:56.93]So I'll be there when you arrive
[03:00.54]The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
[03:04.80]And when you take me in your arms
[03:06.71]And hold me tight
[03:09.06]I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
[03:15:00].
